# My Portfolio Page 
## This is my page for links and projects online

I designed my portfolio to be minimalistic, ensuring it uses as few user resources as possible. 
In a world where the modern web is overloaded with bloated software, Iâ€™m inspired by the philosophy of a lightweight internet. 
Minimalism resonates with me: design should be not only aesthetically pleasing but also functional, with every element serving its purpose.
And so, this page was born

Thank you for being here.
