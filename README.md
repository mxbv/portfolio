# My Portfolio Page 
## This is my page for links and projects online

This simple page is designed to display my contact information, pet projects, and resumes.
I kept it simple for a reason. 
The modern internet is filled with bloated websites and web applications. 
I chose to align with the Light Web (https://the-light-web.net) philosophy, as its principles deeply resonated with me. 
And so, this page was born

Thank you for being here.
